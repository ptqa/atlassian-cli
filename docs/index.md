# Documentation index

Start here. Every document in `docs/` is listed below; add a row when you add a
file.

## Conventions

**Naming.** Dated documents use `DDMMYYYY_topic.md` and describe a specific piece
of work: what changed, why, and what it means for users. Evergreen documents use
`topic.md` and are kept current rather than superseded.

**Categories and required sections.**

| Category | Naming | Required sections |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Architecture | `topic.md` | Context, containers, components, data flows |
| Feature / change | `DDMMYYYY_topic.md` | Status, problem, design notes, limitations, tests |
| Plan | `DDMMYYYY_topic_plan.md` | Context, approach, verification; updated as work progresses |
| Roadmap / status | `topic.md` | Kept current, no date prefix |

**Status lines.** A dated feature document opens with a one-line status
(`shipped in vX.Y.Z (PR #N)`, `in progress on <branch>`, `abandoned, see ...`).
Update it when the work lands; a stale branch name in a merged document is worse
than no status at all.

## Architecture

| Document | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [c4model.md](c4model.md) | **Source of truth for architecture.** Containers, components, services, dependencies and data flows. Read before any architectural change; update in the same PR. |

## Direction

| Document | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [vision.md](vision.md) | Opportunity, positioning, differentiation against ACLI and Appfire |
| [plan.md](plan.md) | Phase completion plan per product area |
| [status.md](status.md) | Per-phase implementation, test and documentation status |
| [todo.md](todo.md) | Roadmap checklist across all phases |

Note: the repository-root `todo.md` is a different file. It is the running log of
changes made, newest last; `docs/todo.md` is the forward-looking roadmap.

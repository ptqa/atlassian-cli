# Changes Made

## 2026-07-13 — Website separated into private repo; removed from public CLI repo

### Context
The website was split out into its own private repo, `omar16100/atlassiancli-site`, deployed via
Cloudflare Pages (`atlassiancli.com` now resolves to Cloudflare via Porkbun nameservers). The public
`atlassian-cli` repo still carried a stale duplicate of the served site under `docs/`, with GitHub Pages
enabled from `main/docs` and a `docs/CNAME` claiming `atlassiancli.com`. PR #87 had bumped that stale
copy to 0.4.3 by mistake; the live private site was still on 0.4.2.

### Live site fix (private repo, direct to main)
Ported the vetted 0.4.3 changelog entry and version bumps (footer badge, `softwareVersion` JSON-LD,
install prose, `llms.txt`; JSON-LD ItemList renumbered) into `atlassiancli-site` and pushed to `main`
so Cloudflare Pages redeploys. 83 files, version-string only.

### Public repo cleanup (chore/remove-public-site)
Removed the 92 served-website files from `docs/` (all HTML/CSS/JS/assets, `CNAME`, `.well-known`,
`robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `llms.txt`, blog/changelog/install/runbooks/product pages). Kept the 23
genuine CLI dev docs (`c4model.md`, `status.md`, `vision.md`, `plan.md`, `todo.md`, dated dev logs,
`examples/*.sh`). Disabled GitHub Pages on the public repo so it stops building from `main/docs` and
releases the orphaned `atlassiancli.com` CNAME claim. README/SECURITY links to `atlassiancli.com/*`
kept as-is (still served by Cloudflare).

### SEO plan relocated + scrubbed from public history
`docs/seo_traffic_growth_plan.md` (website SEO strategy) already existed byte-identical in the private
repo at `research/seo_traffic_growth_plan.md`, so no copy was needed. Removed it from the public repo's
entire git history with `git filter-repo --invert-paths`, then force-pushed the rewritten `main` and all
28 tags. Also deleted two stale merged-PR branches (`chore/deps-production-group` #84,
`fix/confluence-comments-and-attachments` #85) that still carried it, and cleaned 22 stale local
branches. Verified: a normal `git clone` (branches + tags) has zero references to the file and every
release kept its 14 assets. Side effects, accepted by the user: the rewrite stripped GPG signatures
from all 224 signed commits (Verified badges lost repo-wide; no content/author/date/message changed),
and the file still exists in GitHub's read-only `refs/pull/*` PR-snapshot refs, which git cannot rewrite
(purging those requires GitHub Support). Pre-scrub backups saved to the session scratchpad
(`atlassian-cli-pre-scrub.bundle`, `local-branches-backup.bundle`).

### .wrangler + tmp gitignored and scrubbed
Added `.wrangler/` (Cloudflare Pages deploy cache) and `tmp/` (stray Playwright screenshots) to
`.gitignore`, dropped both from tracking at the tip, then ran a second `git filter-repo --invert-paths`
to remove them from all history and force-pushed `main` + tags (only `v0.4.3` contained them, so only
that tag moved; its 14 release assets intact). `.wrangler/cache/wrangler-account.json` had exposed the
Cloudflare account id and account name (no credential). Same `refs/pull/*` residue caveat applies.

## 2026-07-13 — Open-PR sweep: 4 PRs triaged, fixed, merged; release 0.4.3

### Context
Four PRs were open and none could merge as-is, and `main` itself was red: the Security job
(`cargo deny check advisories`) had been failing since ~2026-07-10, unnoticed because `cargo audit` is
`|| echo`-guarded and only `cargo deny` fails the job. CI had never run on the two fork PRs (#79, #81),
which were stuck awaiting workflow approval, so neither had ever been compiled or tested.

### Red main first (#82, fix/security-advisories)
Lockfile-only bumps: quinn-proto 0.11.13 → 0.11.16 (RUSTSEC-2026-0037, -0185; via reqwest),
crossbeam-epoch 0.9.18 → 0.9.20 (RUSTSEC-2026-0204; via criterion/rayon), anyhow 1.0.102 → 1.0.103
(RUSTSEC-2026-0190 unsoundness in `Error::downcast_mut`). Found the anyhow one only by running
`cargo deny check advisories` locally: it still failed after the first two.

### PR #81, Jira GFM tables → ADF (@fabianderschatta), merged
The conversion itself was correct. One defect found and fixed on the branch: ADF forbids `table` inside
`listItem`/`blockquote` (content restricted to paragraph/bulletList/orderedList/codeBlock/media*), but an
indented or quoted markdown table emitted `listItem > table` / `blockquote > table`, which Jira rejects with
a 400 for the whole document, and via `jira bulk import` that fails the entire batch, not one row.
Now degraded to one paragraph per cell, reusing the existing `__transparent__` splice (same precedent as
`blockquote_in_list_item_is_flattened`). Verified `attrs` is optional on table/tableRow/tableCell/tableHeader
against Atlassian's ADF spec, so omitting them is valid.

### PR #79 → #85, Confluence page comments + attachment downloads (@alexevansigg), merged
Both reported bugs real; cherry-picked with authorship preserved, three corrections:
- Comments: per the v2 spec, `FooterCommentModel` has NO top-level `createdAt`; it is `version.createdAt`.
  The PR's `Option<String>` stopped the crash but left the column permanently blank (hard error traded for
  silent data loss). Now reads `version.createdAt`. The command was broken for ANY page with >=1 comment.
- Attachment download: now fetches via `ApiClient::get_bytes` (auth + retries + rate limit + same-origin
  SSRF check, query string preserved) instead of a hand-rolled absolute URL + raw reqwest. Only the `/wiki`
  prefixing is new logic (`attachment_download_path`). Matches `bamboo::download_artifact`.
- Comment body: bounded single-line preview by default, full body behind `--full`, mirroring
  `jira issue comments`.
- The fixture at `crates/cli/tests/confluence_integration.rs:398` had invented a `/wiki`-prefixed
  `downloadLink` the real API never returns, encoding the bug as expected behaviour, which is why no test
  caught it. Corrected. Neither command had ANY test; both now have wiremock coverage.

### PR #80 → #84, aes-gcm 0.11 + indicatif, merged
Dependabot's group could never go green: aes-gcm 0.10 → 0.11 is breaking (aead 0.6,
generic-array → hybrid-array). Migration in `crates/auth/src/encryption.rs`: `aead::OsRng` is gone (nonces
now via the `Generate` trait, using `try_generate` not `generate`, since the latter panics on RNG failure);
`Array::from_slice` deprecated to `TryFrom` (a hard error under `-D warnings`); the orphaned
`argon2::password_hash::rand_core::RngCore` import removed. `derive_key()` and `NONCE_SIZE` frozen.
Dropped `rand` and `zeroize` from crates/auth: direct deps, imported nowhere.

**On-disk compatibility.** Every pre-existing auth test is a same-process round-trip and would pass even if
the format silently changed and orphaned users' `~/.atlassian-cli/credentials.enc`. Generated a
nonce/ciphertext vector with the OLD aes-gcm 0.10 build and pinned it as
`decrypts_ciphertext_written_by_aes_gcm_0_10`. Also live-verified: the new binary decrypted the real local
`credentials.enc` and made an authenticated API call; the file was byte-identical afterwards.

### PR #76, actions/checkout 4 → 7, merged
Red because `release.yml` is generated by cargo-dist (0.30.3), which pins `actions/checkout@v4`; editing it
makes `dist generate --check` fail in the `plan` job. Bumping `cargo-dist-version` would not help, since even dist
0.32 still emits v4. Kept v7 in the three hand-written workflows, left release.yml as dist generates it.
Decision: no dependabot ignore for actions/checkout (it appears in both dist-generated and hand-written
workflows, and ignores are per-dependency, not per-file); future re-proposals get closed manually.

### fix(output), CSV/markdown renderers (found during review, affects every command)
`render_csv` did `row.join(",")` with no quoting: any field with a comma (issue summaries, comment bodies)
shifted every later column, and a newline destroyed the row. Now RFC 4180 quoting. `render_markdown_table`
escaped `|` but not newlines, which terminate the row in markdown. Now `<br>`. This, not the `--full`/preview
split, is the actual fix for the multi-line body hazard; it also repairs `jira issue comments -o csv`.

### Not live-tested
The configured instance has no Confluence (404 on `/wiki/api/v2/spaces`) and no Jira projects, so the
Confluence comment/attachment fixes and the ADF table rendering are covered by unit + wiremock tests and
spec verification, but were not exercised against a live instance. The aes-gcm migration WAS live-verified
against the real credentials file.

### Release 0.4.3
Version bumped in Cargo.toml, the 5 path-dep versions in crates/cli/Cargo.toml, and Cargo.lock.

## 2026-07-11 — SEO content expansion: 50 blog posts + 5 priority fixes (data-driven)

### Context
Live GA4 (520368061) + GSC (sc-domain:atlassiancli.com): ~322 clicks / ~18k impr / 28d (up ~20x from the
early-2026 baseline of 51 clicks/3mo), avg pos ~8.5, but 0 top-10 rankings and a near-zero backlink profile
(1 referring domain per DataForSEO). DataForSEO + Reddit research drove a content + fix plan, codex-reviewed twice.

### Research & planning (research/seo/, unpublished)
- DataForSEO: ranked keywords, Jira/Confluence/Bitbucket/JSM keyword universes, SERP competitors, backlinks, AI/LLM demand.
- Reddit: 59 threads mined (top pain: "no gh-style Bitbucket CLI"; cross-product CLI; Confluence->markdown export).
- CONTENT_AND_FIX_PLAN.md + BING_RECOVERY_AND_BACKLINKS.md. Codex reviews in /Users/macmini/projects/codex/.

### 50 new blog posts (docs/blog/*.html)
- One DISTINCT primary keyword each (dev/CLI/API/automation intent), clustered jira/confluence/bitbucket/jsm/cross,
  interlinked to hubs/runbooks/siblings. Each: BreadcrumbList+Article+FAQPage JSON-LD, canonical, gtag,
  verbatim non-affiliation footer + above-the-fold affiliation note, acli-differentiation, ~1400-2000 body words.
- Adversarial QA gate: 49/50 passed; fixed jsm-integrations-cli (removed non-functional ATLASSIAN_CLI_PROFILE env var).
- All CLI commands verified vs docs/docs/commands.html. 0 em dashes, 0 broken internal links, all JSON-LD parses.

### 5 priority fixes (codex-reordered; backlinks flagged as #1 lever)
1. /jira/ made the definitive "Jira CLI" page (query-first title/meta, commands table, FAQ, exact-anchor internal
   links) to fix the homepage-vs-/jira/ URL-selection issue for "jira cli" (1,900/mo).
2. jira-cli-tools-compared: CTR title rewrite + removed wrong-intent schema keywords.
3. Hub depth on /jira/ /confluence/ /bitbucket/ /jsm/ (command tables, FAQ, internal links).
4. confluence-markdown-sync runbook: markdown-cluster keywords + FAQ + interlinks.
5. Bing recovery + backlinks documented; README deep links; custom docs/404.html.

### Consolidation & compliance
- sitemap.xml 32->82 urls (valid), blog/index.html +50 cards, llms.txt updated.
- Codex implementation review caught + fixed: fabricated Jira hub capabilities, unsupported stats
  ("300% since 2023", "single most upvoted"), wrong acli product coverage, a bad --output flag / bbpr arg order,
  and added above-the-fold non-affiliation notices. Removed false "Atlassian Never Shipped" claim.

### Deploy (DONE 2026-07-11)
- Merged seo/content-expansion-50-blogs -> main, pushed (a039319..34ec806). GitHub Pages build for 34ec806
  completed cleanly (status=built, error=None). Published main source verified via API: sitemap 82 <loc>,
  all sampled new posts + 404.html present. Browser-render check not performed from this env (outbound network
  blocked here); recommend a manual eyeball of 2-3 live URLs.

### Risk noted
- 50 same-day posts on a ~0-backlink domain carries Google scaled-content risk; mitigated via distinct keywords,
  genuine content, strict QA. Recommend noindex on later waves as an opt-in follow-up.

## 2026-07-13 — Jira markdown-to-ADF: GFM table support

### Context
`--description`/comment `--body` markdown tables rendered as raw pipe text in
Jira (`| a | b |` dumped literally) instead of a table. Root cause:
`markdown_to_adf` never enabled pulldown-cmark's `ENABLE_TABLES` option, so
table syntax was never parsed as a table.

### Change (crates/cli/src/commands/jira/adf.rs)
- Enabled `Options::ENABLE_TABLES`.
- Mapped `Table`/`TableHead`/`TableRow`/`TableCell` events to ADF
  `table`/`tableRow`/`tableHeader`/`tableCell` nodes; headings inside table
  cells downgrade to paragraphs (same restriction as list items/blockquotes).
- New unit test `gfm_table_converts_to_adf_table`; manually verified against a
  live Jira issue (table renders correctly via both `--description` and
  comment `--body`).

## 2026-06-18 — Jira sprint UX: --sprint flag + sprint in issue get (#72)

### Context
Issue #72 reported `--field customfield_10020=<id>` failing to set a sprint. Not a
current bug: on 0.4.1 it already sends the working payload, the "204 error" was the
pre-0.4.0 false alarm, and `issue get` didn't show the sprint (so "None" was a
verification artifact). Added ergonomic sprint support.

### Change (crates/cli/src/commands/jira/{issues.rs,mod.rs})
- `--sprint <id>` flag on `jira issue create` and `update`, implemented via the Agile
  API `POST /rest/agile/1.0/sprint/{id}/issue` `{"issues":[KEY]}` (no customfield id,
  avoids the "Number value expected" quirk). New `add_to_sprint` + pure
  `build_sprint_add_payload`; numeric-id validation.
- `update` now PUTs only when there are field changes, so a `--sprint`-only update
  doesn't send an empty `{"fields":{}}`; bails if nothing to update.
- `issue get` now displays the sprint: `IssueFields` reads `customfield_10020`
  (optional/default), `extract_active_sprint` summarizes it ("Sprint 12 (active)"),
  shown in markdown + JSON/table output.
- 5 unit tests; commands.html updated. Also merged dependabot PR #71 (zeroize 1.9.0).

## 2026-06-14 — Site-wide CLI command-syntax cleanup (docs accuracy)

### Context
The docs (commands.html, blog posts, runbooks, example .sh) were written against an
older CLI and used many invalid command forms. Verified every form against the built
binary's --help and corrected them.

### Fixed (all verified against the binary)
- `jira <verb>` -> `jira issue <verb>` (search/get/create/update/delete/transition/
  assign/unassign), including bare `<code>` prose refs.
- `bitbucket pullrequest` -> `bitbucket pr`; `bitbucket permissions` -> `permission`.
- `jsm servicedesk` -> `jsm service-desk` (commands + prose; left `--servicedesk-id`).
- Confluence positional IDs: `page/blog/attachment <verb> --id N` -> positional `N`;
  `attachment list --page-id N` -> `N`; add-label/remove-label/add-comment now positional;
  add/remove-restriction -> `--operation --subject-type --subject-id <PAGE_ID>`;
  space add-permission -> `--permission --subject-type --subject-id <KEY>`.
- `confluence search cql/text/in-space` use positional QUERY/SPACE, not --cql/--query/--space.
- `confluence bulk export/delete --space X` -> `--cql "space = X"` (incl. multi-line/span).
- `confluence analytics page-views/space-stats` use positional ID/KEY.
- jira roles/components/versions use positional `<PROJECT>`/`<ROLE_ID>` not --project/--role-id;
  `jira workflows export` uses positional `<NAME>`.
- `--output json` -> `--format json` on repo list / space get; fixed an invalid
  `pr merge --auto-complete` hero snippet.

### Verification
Built a flag-audit script (/tmp/flagcheck.py) that resolves each documented command's
path against the binary and checks every --flag exists. All 42 command paths valid;
remaining audit hits are false positives (global --profile, one prose `pr create:` line).
Structural-pattern greps all return 0.

## 2026-06-14 — Site: 0.4 release announcement + changelog page

### Context
v0.4.0 and v0.4.1 shipped but were never announced on atlassiancli.com, the site had
no changelog page, and every page still showed v0.3.3.

### Change (docs/ only — the published site)
- New `docs/blog/atlassian-cli-0-4-release.html` — combined "What's New in 0.4" post
  (markdown->ADF, Confluence folders, custom pipelines, 0.4.1 attachments + comments
  --full, the HTTP 204 fix). Mirrors the existing blog template; correct `jira issue`
  command syntax.
- New `docs/changelog/index.html` (`/changelog/`) — version blocks (0.4.1, 0.4.0, 0.3.3,
  link-out for older), CollectionPage/ItemList JSON-LD.
- Wired in: new blog card on `/blog/`, sitemap entries + refreshed lastmods, Changelog
  link in the nav + footer of all primary pages and a docs landing card, `/changelog/`
  added to llms.txt.
- Version sweep 0.3.3 -> 0.4.1 across all 31 footer badges + 5 softwareVersion schemas +
  llms.txt + install prose (exact strings only; historical versions in the changelog
  preserved).
- `docs/docs/commands.html`: added Confluence Folders section + `--custom-pipeline`.
- Verified: all pages serve 200 locally, sitemap valid (xmllint), all JSON-LD parses,
  canonical == og:url.

### Known follow-up (not done here)
`docs/docs/commands.html` and the older `docs/blog/*.html` use a stale `jira <verb>`
syntax (e.g. `jira create`) that should be `jira issue <verb>`. Out of scope for the
announcement; worth a separate cleanup pass.

## 2026-06-12 — Confluence v2 Folder API command group (#49)

### Context
Confluence v2 treats folders as a distinct content type with their own endpoints,
but the CLI had no `confluence folder` command, so folder IDs 404'd against
`page get`. Issue #49 asked for get/create/delete.

### Change
- New `crates/cli/src/commands/confluence/folders.rs`:
  - `folder get <ID>` -> GET /wiki/api/v2/folders/{id} (renders full response Value).
  - `folder create --space <KEY> --title <T> [--parent <ID>]` -> POST
    /wiki/api/v2/folders. Resolves the space key to a numeric spaceId first.
  - `folder delete <ID> [--force]` -> DELETE /wiki/api/v2/folders/{id} via
    `delete_no_content` (moves to trash; copy reflects that).
  - Pure `build_folder_payload`; 4 unit tests.
- New `resolve_space_id(ctx, key)` helper in `confluence/utils.rs`
  (GET /wiki/api/v2/spaces?keys=<key> -> results[0].id).
- Wired `Folder(FolderCommands)` group + dispatch in `confluence/mod.rs`.
- Codex-reviewed (no blockers); applied both should-fixes: `get` preserves the full
  response, delete copy says "move to trash" not "permanently delete".
- The `page list` parse bug also referenced in #49 shipped earlier in #56.

## 2026-06-12 — Markdown to ADF for Jira descriptions/comments (#39)

### Context
`--description` (and comment bodies) wrapped the whole string in a single ADF
paragraph, flattening headings/lists/bold. Issue #39 asked the CLI to parse
structure into multi-node ADF.

### Change
- New `crates/cli/src/commands/jira/adf.rs`: `markdown_to_adf(text) -> Value` parses
  CommonMark via `pulldown-cmark` (added, default-features off) into ADF: paragraph,
  heading (attrs.level), bulletList/orderedList (attrs.order) + listItem, codeBlock
  (attrs.language), blockquote, rule, marks strong/em/strike/code/link, hardBreak.
- Removed `plain_text_adf`; repointed description (`build_create_payload`,
  `build_update_payload`, `build_bulk_payload`) and comments (`add_comment`,
  `update_comment`) to `markdown_to_adf`. Plain text still yields a single paragraph.
- Updated `--description` help text (create + update).
- Codex-reviewed; fixed 4 ADF-schema findings: `code` mark only combines with `link`;
  heading downgraded to paragraph inside listItem/blockquote; blockquote flattened
  inside listItem (and nested blockquote); empty listItem/blockquote get an empty
  paragraph; empty-href links stay plain text.
- 16 adf unit tests; full `cargo test` + `cargo clippy` clean.

### Behavior change
`--description` now interprets markdown. Plain text is unaffected (single paragraph),
but text containing markdown syntax (`#`, `-`, `**`, backticks, links) now renders
structured. `--field description=<json>` remains the raw-ADF escape hatch.

## 2026-06-12 — Drop unmaintained proc-macro-error2; fixes Security Audit (#53)

### Context
CI `cargo deny check advisories` failed repo-wide on RUSTSEC-2026-0173
(`proc-macro-error2` unmaintained), pulled transitively via `tabled` ->
`tabled_derive`. This blocked the dependabot dep-bump PR #53 and every other PR.

### Change
- `Cargo.toml`: `tabled = { version = "0.21", default-features = false, features = ["std"] }`.
  The repo only uses `tabled::builder::Builder` and `tabled::settings::Style`, never
  `#[derive(Tabled)]`, so disabling the default `derive` feature drops `tabled_derive`
  and `proc-macro-error2` entirely. Proper removal, not a deny.toml suppression. Also
  takes the tabled 0.20 -> 0.21 bump from #53.
- Verified: `cargo tree -i proc-macro-error2` and `tabled_derive` both empty;
  `cargo deny check advisories` = ok; full `cargo test` + `cargo clippy` clean;
  table render output unchanged.

## 2026-06-11 — Bug fixes: HTTP 204 false errors (#45) + Confluence list parse (#49)

### Context
Issue triage flagged two real defects. #45: mutating Jira/Confluence commands (update,
transition, assign, deletes) exited non-zero with "error decoding response body" even
though the write succeeded, because the API returns HTTP 204 No Content and the client
parsed the empty body as JSON. #49 (trailing note): `confluence page list` failed with
the same parse error because list structs had required `String` fields the v2 API can
omit or null. Codex reviewed the fix design (read-only).

### #45 — central fix in `crates/api/src/lib.rs`
- `request()` success arm now reads body bytes and treats an empty or whitespace-only
  body as JSON `null` before deserializing (was `response.json::<T>()` unconditionally).
- Callers discard the body as `let _: Value`, so they receive `Value::Null` and succeed.
  No call-site changes; fixes all 204-returning endpoints at once.
- Added 3 wiremock tests: 204 PUT → Ok(Null), empty 200 → Ok(Null), JSON 200 still parses.

### #49 — defensive deserialization on Confluence list structs
- `Page` (pages.rs), `Space` (spaces.rs), `SearchResult` (search.rs): non-`id` string
  fields are now `Option<String>` with `#[serde(default)]` (handles both absent AND null;
  plain serde default does not cover explicit null). Rendered via `.as_deref().unwrap_or("")`.

Verification: `cargo test` (all pass, +3 new), `cargo clippy --all-targets` clean.

## 2026-04-21 - Week-4 SEO: breadcrumbs on blog/runbook pages

### Context
Blog and runbook pages had no BreadcrumbList schema, so Google couldn't render breadcrumbs in SERP and didn't have structural signals for `Home > Blog/Runbooks > Post` hierarchy. Codex previously flagged this as worth adding — especially on hierarchical collection pages where it reflects real structure.

### Changes
- [DONE] Added BreadcrumbList JSON-LD to 18 pages (8 blog + 10 runbook), placed before existing Article/HowTo/FAQPage schema blocks
- [DONE] Breadcrumb names extracted from each page's H1 (or title fallback) for accurate labels
- [DONE] All three levels populated: home → section → page

### Verification
- All 18 pages return 200 and parse multiple JSON-LD blocks cleanly
- Blog pages: BreadcrumbList + Article (some also have FAQPage pre-existing)
- Runbook pages: BreadcrumbList + HowTo

---

## 2026-04-21 - Week-4 SEO: deepened hub pages for head-term ranking

### Context
After 3 rounds of SEO work (homepage, install hub, first-party docs), hub pages still ranked pos 30-70 for their canonical terms (`/jira/` pos 64 for "jira cli", `/confluence/` pos 33 for "confluence cli", `/bitbucket/` pos 60 for "bitbucket cli"). Codex's next-priority recommendation was to deepen hub content so these can outrank Appfire, marketplace.atlassian.com, and the github.com/ankit1/jira-cli README.

### Changes
For each of /jira/, /confluence/, /bitbucket/ hub pages:
- [DONE] Added "What is [X] CLI?" intro section (2 substantive paragraphs, links to sibling hubs + /install/ + /docs/auth.html + /docs/commands.html)
- [DONE] Added "When to use a [X] CLI" section with 5 real use-case bullets, each linking to a runbook
- [DONE] Added a semantic `<table>` "command groups" cluster — each row deep-links to /docs/commands.html anchor
- [DONE] Added visible FAQ section (6-7 Qs per page) covering install/auth/custom fields/CQL/bearer vs basic/CI patterns/open-source/DC compatibility — no schema markup per prior codex guidance
- [DONE] Hero now includes "Commands" link pointing to the relevant /docs/commands.html section
- [DONE] All internal links use descriptive anchor text ("Confluence backup runbook", "auth guide", etc.)

### Word count growth
- /jira/: ~700 → ~1344 words
- /confluence/: ~700 → ~1207 words
- /bitbucket/: ~700 → ~1172 words

### Verification
- All 9 canonical URLs return 200
- Word count measured on rendered output
- All command-table anchors match real /docs/commands.html section IDs (#jira-issues, #jira-bulk, #conf-search, #conf-bulk, #bb-repos, #bb-pr, etc.)

---

## 2026-04-18 - Week-3 SEO: first-party docs at /docs/ (codex-reviewed twice)

### Context
Prior codex review flagged "biggest skipped item is first-party docs on atlassiancli.com" — the "Docs" nav link was going to the GitHub README, limiting SEO depth, sitelink potential, and ability to rank for longer-tail docs queries. Built a 3-page docs section (strategy: depth over breadth, avoid thin-content indexing issues).

### Changes
- [DONE] NEW `docs/docs/index.html` — landing page with TOC (guides, product pages, runbooks)
- [DONE] NEW `docs/docs/auth.html` — authentication guide targeting "atlassian cli authentication" (23 GSC impr), "jira cli login" (4), "atlassian cli token" (3). Sections: overview, API tokens, Bitbucket bearer + API token, profiles, env vars & CI/CD, credential storage, troubleshooting
- [DONE] NEW `docs/docs/commands.html` — consolidated command reference with sticky left sidebar TOC. All 4 products covered with subsection groups. HowTo-schema-free (replaced with TechArticle).
- [DONE] Added "Docs" to nav on homepage + 4 hub pages + /install/ (6 pages total)
- [DONE] Homepage footer expanded with /docs/, /docs/auth.html, /docs/commands.html links
- [DONE] `docs/sitemap.xml` — added 3 new URLs
- [DONE] All 4 hub pages: footer "Documentation" link repointed from GitHub README to /docs/
- [DONE] Hub pages (jira, confluence, bitbucket, jsm): `--output json|csv|yaml|table|quiet|markdown` → `--format ...` (20 swaps total; `--output file.json` form preserved where correctly writing to a file)
- [DONE] Hub pages: "Full Documentation" resource cards on bitbucket/jsm now point to specific `/docs/commands.html#` anchors
- [DONE] Added `<main>` landmark to `/docs/` and `/docs/auth.html` (commands.html already had `<main class="doc-content">`)

### Codex-flagged accuracy fixes (second and third passes)
- ENV VARS: rewrote against actual source — `ATLASSIAN_CLI_TOKEN_<PROFILE>`, `ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN`, `ATLASSIAN_CLI_BITBUCKET_TOKEN_<PROFILE>`, `ATLASSIAN_BITBUCKET_TOKEN`, `BITBUCKET_TOKEN`. Removed false "skip auth login entirely" claim — profile metadata (base_url, email, workspace) still required
- BITBUCKET AUTH: I had Basic/Bearer flipped. Fixed to match actual semantics:
  * Basic auth = Atlassian API tokens (current, requires --email)
  * Bearer auth = repository/workspace/project access tokens (requires --bearer, no --email needed, workspace optional)
  * App passwords: deprecated (Sep 9, 2025 creation ended; Jun 9, 2026 existing tokens disabled)
- GLOBAL FLAGS: `--verbose` → `--debug` (plus added `markdown` format, `--envelope`, `--config`)
- JSM COMMAND NAMES: `jsm servicedesk` → `jsm service-desk` (kebab-case in clap derive), `requesttype` → `request-type`. 13 swaps across commands.html + /jsm/ hub
- JSM COVERAGE: added missing `request-type {list,get,fields,groups}` group + `organization add-user` / `remove-user`. Full JSM section now: service-desk, request-type, request, queue, approval, sla, customer, organization, kb, feedback (10 subcommand groups)
- AUTH SUBCOMMANDS: removed `auth set-default` (hallucinated — doesn't exist). Real surface: login/logout/list/status/whoami/test. Added correct "change default" instructions (re-run `auth login --default` or edit config.yaml)
- BASE URL: all 10 pages now show `--base-url https://your-domain.atlassian.net` (CLI rejects non-HTTPS URLs)
- JIRA HUB: `--base-url your-domain.atlassian.net` → `--base-url https://your-domain.atlassian.net` in quickstart

### Verification
- All 11 URLs return 200: /, /jira/, /confluence/, /bitbucket/, /jsm/, /install/, /docs/, /docs/auth.html, /docs/commands.html, /blog/, /sitemap.xml
- All JSON-LD blocks valid: /docs/ has BreadcrumbList, /docs/auth.html and /docs/commands.html each have BreadcrumbList + TechArticle
- Zero `auth set-default`, zero `jsm servicedesk` (no-hyphen), zero `--verbose`, zero base-url missing-scheme
- Exactly one `<main>` landmark per docs page
- Codex reviews archived:
  * `/Users/macmini/projects/codex/atlassiancli_seo_week3_review_18apr2026.txt`
  * `/Users/macmini/projects/codex/atlassiancli_seo_week3_verify_18apr2026.txt`

### Next priority (per codex)
Hub page content depth — `/jira/`, `/confluence/`, `/bitbucket/` currently rank pos 30-70 for canonical terms. Need more content weight to outrank Appfire, marketplace.atlassian.com, github.com. After that: backlinks (awesome-* lists, Show HN, crates.io polish). Defer blog modifier content and breadcrumbs on old content.

## 2026-04-18 - Week-2 SEO: hub pages + install hub (codex-reviewed)

### Context
After week-1 homepage rewrite, focus shifts to product hubs + install funnel. GSC shows `/jira/` ranks pos 64 for "jira cli" (128 impr), `/confluence/` at pos 33 for "confluence cli" (309 impr). Hub nav was missing sibling links (no internal linking between /jira/, /confluence/, /bitbucket/, /jsm/). Install-intent queries (atlassian cli install 21 impr, brew install atlassian cli 15 impr, atlassian cli download 17 impr) had no dedicated landing.

### Changes
- [DONE] `docs/jira/index.html` - nav now has Jira/Confluence/Bitbucket/Blog sibling links, `aria-current="page"` on self
- [DONE] `docs/confluence/index.html` - same nav pattern + fixed 3 broken runbook links (pointed to nonexistent files)
- [DONE] `docs/bitbucket/index.html` - same nav pattern
- [DONE] `docs/jsm/index.html` - same nav pattern + title changed from acronym-first "JSM CLI" to "Jira Service Management CLI (JSM)" (better search behavior match)
- [DONE] `docs/install/index.html` - NEW install hub page (~180 lines): Homebrew, Cargo, prebuilt binary, verify, first-time setup, troubleshooting sections
- [DONE] BreadcrumbList JSON-LD added to 5 pages (4 hubs + install)
- [DONE] Bulk repoint of `/#install` → `/install/` across 23 files (all hub, blog, runbook pages)
- [DONE] `docs/sitemap.xml` - added /install/ entry, bumped 5 pages lastmod to 2026-04-18 (only changed ones)
- [DONE] Homepage footer gained `/install/` link

### Codex feedback incorporated
- Fixed broken Confluence runbook links (`/runbooks/confluence-backup-space.html` etc. → real files `confluence-backup.html`, `confluence-markdown-sync.html`, `confluence-bulk-cleanup.html`)
- Removed "curl" and "Docker" from install page title (page body doesn't have those sections)
- Replaced semantically-wrong HowTo schema (alternative methods modeled as sequential steps) with TechArticle schema
- Repointed all hub Install CTAs to /install/ (were going to homepage #install, weakening new page's internal link signal)

### Verification
- Local server: `/`, `/jira/`, `/confluence/`, `/bitbucket/`, `/jsm/`, `/install/`, `/blog/`, `/sitemap.xml` all return 200
- All 6 main pages have valid JSON-LD blocks
- All 4 hub pages' nav-btn Install button resolves to `/install/`
- Codex review: `/Users/macmini/projects/codex/atlassiancli_seo_week2_review_18apr2026.txt`

### Explicitly deferred (per codex)
- BreadcrumbList on blog/runbook pages (would be Home > Blog > Post; real hierarchy)
- First-party docs on atlassiancli.com (replacing GitHub-only Docs link) — highest-remaining-leverage item
- JSM redirect to /jira/ (codex: keep separate page, small-volume but distinct intent)

## 2026-04-18 - Homepage SEO rewrite (week-1, codex-reviewed)

### Context
GSC data: 51 clicks / 5,960 impressions / 0.9% CTR / pos 14.5 over 3 months. Homepage ranks pos 7.3 for "atlassian cli" (2,415 impr) but CTR is 0.79% — title/H1 were slogan-first ("Atlassian Cloud as Code") not query-first. Product cards on homepage were not crawlable (no `<a>` wrapping), so `/jira/`, `/confluence/`, `/bitbucket/`, `/jsm/` got zero internal link juice from the top page.

### Changes
- [DONE] `docs/index.html` — new `<title>`, meta description, og:*, twitter:*, og:site_name
- [DONE] `docs/index.html` — H1 changed from "Atlassian Cloud as Code" → "Atlassian CLI" (query-first)
- [DONE] `docs/index.html` — nav now has Jira/Confluence/Bitbucket/Blog links (removed redundant Docs→GitHub)
- [DONE] `docs/index.html` — product cards wrapped in `<a href="/jira/">` etc. (4 new crawlable links)
- [DONE] `docs/index.html` — product card headings renamed "Jira" → "Jira CLI" etc. for better anchor text
- [DONE] `docs/index.html` — added WebSite JSON-LD with alternateName; updated SoftwareApplication
- [DONE] `docs/index.html` — footer expanded with hub + runbook links
- [DONE] `docs/styles.css` — `.product-card` now `display:block; color:inherit; text-decoration:none` (anchor compatibility)
- [DONE] `docs/llms.txt` — version bumped to 0.3.3

### Verification
- HTML parses cleanly (only false-positive `</link>` which is HTML5 self-closing)
- Both JSON-LD blocks valid JSON; @type=WebSite and @type=SoftwareApplication
- Local server: `/`, `/jira/`, `/confluence/`, `/bitbucket/`, `/jsm/` all return 200
- Raw research data: `/Users/macmini/projects/codex/atlassiancli_seo_18apr2026/`
- Codex review: `/Users/macmini/projects/codex/atlassiancli_seo_week1_review_18apr2026.txt`

### Explicitly not done (per codex review)
- Misspelling hint copy (spammy)
- FAQ schema as SEO hack (Google limits FAQ rich results to gov/health)
- OG image upgrade (not a week-1 lever)
- Sitemap lastmod bump without real content changes

## 2026-04-02 - Jira Search API Migration & 410 Error Handling

### Context
Atlassian removed `/rest/api/3/search` (returns 410 Gone per CHANGE-2046). Bulk operations still used old endpoint. API client had no 410 handling — errors fell to generic ServerError with misleading "auth expired" context messages.

### Changes
- [DONE] `crates/cli/src/commands/jira/bulk.rs` — migrated `bulk_export` (line 225) and `search_issue_keys` (line 402) from `POST /rest/api/3/search` to `POST /rest/api/3/search/jql`; converted `fields` from comma-string to array
- [DONE] `crates/api/src/error.rs` — added `EndpointGone` variant with suggestion text, `is_retryable() → false`, unit tests
- [DONE] `crates/api/src/lib.rs` — added `StatusCode::GONE` arm in all 4 HTTP method match blocks
- [DONE] `crates/cli/tests/jira_integration.rs` — updated search mock to new endpoint, added `test_jira_search_410_returns_endpoint_gone` test
- [DONE] `docs/02042026_jira_search_migration.md` — migration documentation

### Notes
- Bug 1 (`auth test` false failure) and Bug 2 (`jira issue search`) were already fixed in v0.3.1 — `auth test` uses `/rest/api/3/myself`, `issue search` uses `/rest/api/3/search/jql`
- Only bulk operations and error handling remained broken

## 2026-03-14 - SEO & Traffic Growth Implementation

### Context
Site was ranking for only 5 keywords (all positions 41-90+) despite target keywords exploding in volume (jira cli: +303% YoY, atlassian cli: +6400% YoY). Root causes: single-page site, zero backlinks, no GSC, no structured data. ChatGPT already drives 8% of traffic without optimization.

## 2026-02-20 - Bitbucket Bearer Auth Support & App Password Deprecation

### Context
Bitbucket app passwords deprecated (creation disabled Sep 2025, all disabled Jun 2026).
atlassian-cli only supported Basic auth in CLI paths despite API layer having Bearer support.

### Changes

**Priority 1: Help text & error message updates** (`crates/cli/src/commands/auth.rs`)
- Updated `read_token_from_stdin()` — replaced app password URL with Bitbucket API token instructions
- Updated `test_bitbucket_auth()` failure message — added deprecation hint and bearer suggestion
- Updated `LoginArgs` after_help — added bearer example and deprecation notice
- Updated `list_profiles()` — added `bitbucket_auth` column showing basic/bearer

**Priority 2: Bearer auth support**
- `crates/config/src/lib.rs` — Added `bitbucket_token_type: Option<String>` to `Profile` struct
- `crates/cli/src/commands/auth.rs`:
  - Added `--bearer` flag to `LoginArgs` (requires `--bitbucket`)
  - Made `--email` optional (not required for `--bearer`)
  - Added `is_bitbucket_bearer()` helper
  - Updated `login_bitbucket()` to store token_type in profile
  - Updated `test_bitbucket_auth()` to use `/2.0/workspaces` for bearer tokens
  - Updated `auth_status()` to build bearer client and use correct endpoint
- `crates/cli/src/main.rs`:
  - Added `is_bearer` field to `BitbucketProfile`
  - Updated `resolve_profile_for_bitbucket()` — email optional for bearer
  - Updated `build_bitbucket_client()` — uses `with_bearer_token()` for bearer
  - Passes `is_bearer` through to `bitbucket::execute()`
- `crates/cli/src/commands/bitbucket/utils.rs`:
  - Added `is_bearer` field to `BitbucketContext`
  - Updated `verify_auth()` — uses `/2.0/workspaces` for bearer tokens
- `crates/cli/src/commands/bitbucket/mod.rs` — passes `is_bearer` to context
- `crates/cli/src/commands/bitbucket/workspaces.rs` — `whoami()` shows workspaces for bearer

**Doc fixes**
- `crates/config/src/lib.rs` — fixed "keyring" reference in Profile doc comment to "encrypted credential files"

### Tests Added
- Config: 6 tests for `bitbucket_token_type` (default none, bearer, skip serialization, backwards compat, roundtrip)
- Auth: 4 tests for `is_bitbucket_bearer()` (default, bearer, basic, nonexistent)
- CLI integration: 2 tests (bearer flag in help, bearer profile no email required)

### Key Design Decisions
- Bearer tokens use `/2.0/workspaces` instead of `/2.0/user` (access tokens are not user-scoped)
- `--email` is optional when `--bearer` is set
- Token type stored in profile config (not credential store) for simplicity
- Env vars (`BITBUCKET_TOKEN`) default to whatever `bitbucket_token_type` the profile specifies

## 2026-01-31 - Add Pipeline Variable/Secret Management

### Feature
Full CRUD for Bitbucket pipeline variables at 3 scopes: repository, workspace, and deployment environment.

### CLI Commands
```
bb pipeline var list [--workspace-level | --deployment <env>]
bb pipeline var get --key <KEY> [--workspace-level | --deployment <env>]
bb pipeline var create --key <KEY> --value <VAL> [--secured] [--workspace-level | --deployment <env>]
bb pipeline var update --key <KEY> --value <VAL> [--secured | --unsecured] [--workspace-level | --deployment <env>]
bb pipeline var delete --key <KEY> --force [--workspace-level | --deployment <env>]
bb pipeline env list
```

### Key Design Decisions
- Tri-state `--secured`/`--unsecured` on update (neither = preserve current state)
- Key-based operations with transparent UUID resolution
- Environment name-to-UUID resolution (case-insensitive)
- `delete_no_content()` in ApiClient for 204 responses
- `type: "pipeline_variable"` in create/update payloads

### Files Created
- `crates/cli/src/commands/bitbucket/variables.rs` — data structures, CRUD functions, resolution helpers, 13 unit tests

### Files Modified
- `crates/api/src/lib.rs` — added `delete_no_content()` method
- `crates/cli/src/commands/bitbucket/mod.rs` — added VarCommands, EnvCommands, dispatch logic

### Tests
- 13 new unit tests (URL building, deserialization, payload format, scope labels, UUID cleaning, secured display)
- All 310 tests pass, zero clippy warnings

## 2026-01-31 - Fix `--repo` flag for pipeline commands

### Problem
`bb pipeline list --repo genai_images` failed — `repo` was a positional arg on each pipeline subcommand, shadowing the global `--repo` flag from `BitbucketArgs`. Also, 5 of 10 pipeline subcommands panicked on `--help` due to invalid clap positional ordering (optional `repo` before required `pipeline_id`).

### Changes
- Removed positional `repo: Option<String>` from all 10 `PipelineCommands` variants
- Updated all 10 handler match arms to use global `--repo` via `require_repo(None, global_repo.as_deref(), ...)`
- Updated `require_repo()` error message to reference `--repo` flag only

### Result
- `bb pipeline list --repo genai_images` now works
- `bb --repo genai_images pipeline list` works
- `bb pipeline list` auto-detects from git remote
- `bb pipeline get 42` works (pipeline_id as sole positional)
- No more `--help` panics on get/stop/logs/watch/steps

### File Modified
- `crates/cli/src/commands/bitbucket/mod.rs`

## 2026-01-31 - Fix Silent Auth Failure on Search + Related Issues

### Problem
`jira issue search --assignee @me` returns "No issues found" when auth is expired. Jira's API returns HTTP 200 with empty results when permissions-based filtering removes everything. The code printed "No issues found" without validating credentials.

### Changes

1. **Fix ANSI in tracing output** (`crates/cli/src/main.rs`)
   - Added `.with_ansi(std::io::stderr().is_terminal())` to tracing fmt builder
   - Non-TTY output no longer contains ANSI escape codes

2. **Add `Forbidden` variant to ApiError** (`crates/api/src/error.rs`)
   - New `Forbidden { message: String }` variant for 403 responses
   - Shares suggestion with `AuthenticationFailed` (points to `auth test`)
   - Not retryable
   - Added 3 unit tests

3. **Handle 403 in API client** (`crates/api/src/lib.rs`)
   - Added `StatusCode::FORBIDDEN` arm in `request()`, `get_text()`, `get_bytes()`
   - Returns `ApiError::Forbidden` with response body as message
   - Added 4 wiremock tests (403 JSON, 403 text, 403 bytes, 401 auth)

4. **Display error suggestions in main** (`crates/cli/src/main.rs`)
   - Restructured: `main()` → `run()` pattern
   - `main()` catches errors, downcasts to `ApiError`, shows `.suggestion()` on stderr
   - Exits with code 1 on error

5. **Add `verify_auth()` to context types**
   - `JiraContext` → `/rest/api/3/myself` (`crates/cli/src/commands/jira/utils.rs`)
   - `JsmContext` → `/rest/api/3/myself` (`crates/cli/src/commands/jsm/utils.rs`)
   - `ConfluenceContext` → `/wiki/rest/api/user/current` (`crates/cli/src/commands/confluence/utils.rs`)
   - `BitbucketContext` → `/2.0/user` (`crates/cli/src/commands/bitbucket/utils.rs`)
   - `BambooContext` → `/rest/api/latest/info` (`crates/cli/src/commands/bamboo/utils.rs`)

6. **Auth check on empty results** (high-impact commands)
   - `jira issue search` (`crates/cli/src/commands/jira/issues.rs:95`)
   - `confluence search` (`crates/cli/src/commands/confluence/search.rs`)
   - `bitbucket repo list` (`crates/cli/src/commands/bitbucket/repos.rs:73`)
   - `bitbucket pr list` (`crates/cli/src/commands/bitbucket/pullrequests.rs:147`)
   - `bamboo build list` (`crates/cli/src/commands/bamboo/builds.rs:48`)
   - `jsm request list` (`crates/cli/src/commands/jsm/requests.rs:87`)
   - `jsm servicedesk list` (`crates/cli/src/commands/jsm/servicedesk.rs:66`)

### Files Modified

### Tests
- 7 new tests (3 error.rs unit tests + 4 wiremock integration tests)
- All 226 tests pass

## 2026-01-31 - Merge Dependabot Cargo Deps Bump (PR #29)

### Problem
PR #29 bumped 10 cargo dependencies (clap, tokio, reqwest, serde_json, colored, thiserror, chrono, url, whoami, indexmap). Security Audit failed because `reqwest 0.12→0.13` switched to rustls by default, pulling in `aws-lc-rs` with ISC/OpenSSL licenses and `webpki-root-certs` with CDLA-Permissive-2.0 — none in deny.toml allowlist.

### Changes
- Added `ISC`, `OpenSSL`, `CDLA-Permissive-2.0` to `deny.toml` license allowlist (all permissive, OSI-approved)
- Removed stale `RUSTSEC-2025-0119` ignore (number_prefix no longer in dep tree after updates)

### File Modified
- `deny.toml`

## 2026-01-27 - Website Footer Credit
- Added "Built by Omar Shabab" credit with link to omarshabab.com
- Added `.footer-credit` styling to match existing footer aesthetic
- Files modified: `docs/index.html`, `docs/styles.css`

## 2026-01-25 - CLI UX Improvements from User Feedback

### Issue 1: Rename `--output` to `--format` (global flag)
- Renamed `--output` to `--format` to avoid conflict with subcommand `--output` file path flags
- Made flag global with `global = true` so it works on all subcommands
- Added short flag `-f` for convenience
- File: `crates/cli/src/main.rs:27-29, 81`

### Issue 2: Build number support for `pipeline logs`
- Changed `pipeline_uuid` to `pipeline_id` in Logs command enum
- Added `resolve_pipeline_id()` call before `get_pipeline_logs()`
- Now accepts both build numbers (e.g., `335`) and UUIDs
- File: `crates/cli/src/commands/bitbucket/mod.rs:481-485, 1131-1158`

### Issue 3: Improve 406 error handling for log fetching
- Changed Accept header from `text/plain; charset=utf-8` to `text/plain, */*;q=0.1`
- Added explicit `StatusCode::NOT_ACCEPTABLE` (406) handling
- File: `crates/api/src/lib.rs:202, 224-232`

### Issue 4: Add browser URL to log fetch errors
- Error messages now include browser URL for manual viewing
- URL format: `https://bitbucket.org/{workspace}/{repo}/pipelines/results/{uuid}/steps/{step_uuid}`
- File: `crates/cli/src/commands/bitbucket/pipelines.rs:890-913`

### Files Modified
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `crates/cli/src/main.rs` | Rename output→format, add global=true |
| `crates/cli/src/commands/bitbucket/mod.rs` | Logs command uses pipeline_id + resolve |
| `crates/cli/src/commands/bitbucket/pipelines.rs` | Browser URL in error messages |
| `crates/api/src/lib.rs` | Broader Accept header, 406 handling |
| `crates/cli/tests/cli_integration.rs` | Updated test to use --format |

## 2026-01-25 - Fix Homebrew Formula Release Workflow

- Release workflow failing since v0.2.1 due to cargo-dist version mismatch
- Dependabot bumped `actions/checkout@v4` to `@v6`, but cargo-dist expects v4
- Regenerated `.github/workflows/release.yml` via `dist init`
- Re-tagged v0.2.4 to trigger new release build with homebrew formula update
- File: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

## 2026-01-25 - Fix Homebrew Installation Command

- Fixed incorrect Homebrew install command on website
- Changed `omar16100/tap/atlassian-cli` → `omar16100/atlassian-cli/atlassian-cli`
- File: `docs/index.html` (lines 86-87, 350-351)

## 2026-01-19 - UX Improvements

### Issue 1: Auth UX - Hint for `--bitbucket-token`
- Added clap error hook in `main.rs` to detect `--bitbucket-token` typo and suggest correct syntax
- Added `after_help` to `LoginArgs` in `auth.rs` showing examples for Jira and Bitbucket auth
- Files: `crates/cli/src/main.rs`, `crates/cli/src/commands/auth.rs`

### Issue 2: Add `auth status` Command
- New command: `atlassian-cli auth status [--profile <name>] [--configured-only]`
- Shows authentication status for all services: Jira/Confluence, Bitbucket, OpsGenie, Bamboo
- Tests actual API connectivity for Jira and Bitbucket (shows OK/FAILED/N/A)
- OpsGenie and Bamboo show CONFIGURED status (API key present)
- `--configured-only` flag hides N/A entries
- File: `crates/cli/src/commands/auth.rs`

### Issue 3: Pipeline Repo Auto-Detection Error Messages
- Created `require_repo()` helper function for better error messages
- Used across all pipeline commands (list, get, trigger, stop, logs, watch, steps, status, rerun)
- Error now shows: "Repository required for '<cmd>'. Not in a git directory with Bitbucket remote."
- File: `crates/cli/src/commands/bitbucket/mod.rs`

### Issue 4: Build Number vs UUID - Renamed `uuid` to `pipeline_id`
- Renamed `uuid` field to `pipeline_id` in Get, Stop, Watch, Steps commands
- Clarifies that both build numbers and UUIDs are accepted
- Made `resolve_pipeline_id()` public for use in Stop command
- Files: `crates/cli/src/commands/bitbucket/mod.rs`, `crates/cli/src/commands/bitbucket/pipelines.rs`

### Issue 5: Add Commit Hash to Pipeline Output
- Added `commit` field to `PipelineRow`, `PipelineView`, `PipelineStatusOutput` structs
- Shows short hash (7 chars) of the commit that triggered the pipeline
- Added `get_commit_hash()` helper function
- Visible in: `pipeline list`, `pipeline get`, `pipeline status`, `pipeline watch`
- File: `crates/cli/src/commands/bitbucket/pipelines.rs`

### Issue 6: Improve Auth Failure Error Messages
- Improved Bitbucket auth error message to mention `auth list` command
- Shows: "Check token status: atlassian-cli auth list"
- Updated `AuthenticationFailed` suggestion in error.rs to mention both `auth list` and `auth test`
- Files: `crates/cli/src/main.rs`, `crates/api/src/error.rs`

### Files Modified

## 2026-01-15 - Bug Fixes for JSM, OpsGenie & Bamboo Modules

### Double Rendering Bug Fix
- Fixed 6 locations where `println!()` + early return broke JSON/YAML output
- Files fixed:
  - `crates/cli/src/commands/bamboo/projects.rs:40-45` - list_projects
  - `crates/cli/src/commands/jsm/requests.rs:86-91` - list_requests
  - `crates/cli/src/commands/opsgenie/alerts.rs:57-62` - list_alerts
  - `crates/cli/src/commands/opsgenie/alerts.rs:407-412` - list_recipients
  - `crates/cli/src/commands/opsgenie/alerts.rs:441-446` - list_logs
  - `crates/cli/src/commands/opsgenie/alerts.rs:473-478` - list_notes
- Now always renders via ctx.renderer.render() for consistent output format support

### OpsGenie Query Parameter Bug Fix
- Fixed `crates/cli/src/commands/opsgenie/alerts.rs:14-27`
- When both `--query` and `--status` provided, they were overwriting each other
- Now combines them with " AND " for proper OpsGenie query syntax

## 2026-01-14 - JSM, OpsGenie & Bamboo CLI Implementation

### Phase 1: JSM Enhancement (Refactored to Module)
- Refactored `jsm.rs` → `jsm/` module directory structure
- Created files:
  - `mod.rs` - Main routing with full command enum definitions
  - `utils.rs` - JsmContext, ServiceDesk, RequestType, Customer, Organization types
  - `requesttypes.rs` - list_request_types, get_request_type
  - `customers.rs` - list_customers, get_customer, create_customer, delete_customer
  - `feedback.rs` - list_feedback, get_feedback
  - `knowledgebase.rs` - list_articles, get_article
- Full CRUD for service desk requests with transitions, comments, attachments, participants
- Added `delete_with_body()` method to ApiClient for JSM endpoints requiring body in DELETE

### Phase 2: OpsGenie Implementation (NEW)
- Created `opsgenie/` module with EU/US region support
- Added `GenieKey` authentication to ApiClient
  - New `AuthMethod::GenieKey { api_key }` variant
  - `with_genie_key()` builder method
  - Sets `Authorization: GenieKey {key}` header
- Created files:
  - `utils.rs` - OpsgenieContext, Alert, Incident, Schedule, Team, Escalation, Service, Heartbeat types
  - `alerts.rs` - list, get, create, close, acknowledge, snooze, escalate, assign, add_note, delete, list_recipients, list_logs, list_notes
  - `incidents.rs` - list, get, create, close, resolve, reopen, add_responder, add_note, delete, list_timeline
  - `schedules.rs` - list, get, create, delete, enable, disable, get_on_call, get_timeline, export_ical
  - `teams.rs` - list, get, create, delete, list_members, add_member, remove_member, get_on_call
  - `escalations.rs` - list, get, create, delete
  - `services.rs` - list, get, create, delete
  - `heartbeats.rs` - list, get, create, delete, enable, disable, ping
  - `mod.rs` - Full command enum definitions and routing
- Added config profile fields:
  - `opsgenie_api_key: Option<String>`
  - `opsgenie_region: Option<String>` ("us" or "eu")
- Added `OPSGENIE_API_KEY` and `OPSGENIE_REGION` env var support with fallback to profile

### Phase 3: Bamboo Implementation (NEW)
- Created `bamboo/` module with full CI/CD operations
- Created files:
  - `utils.rs` - BambooContext, Project, Plan, Branch, BuildResult, Agent, DeploymentProject, Environment, Artifact types
  - `projects.rs` - list_projects, get_project
  - `plans.rs` - list, get, enable, disable, favorite, unfavorite

### Phase 4: Cross-Cutting Concerns
- Updated `main.rs`:
  - `resolve_profile_for_opsgenie()` - env var first, then profile config
  - `build_opsgenie_client()` - uses GenieKey auth
  - `resolve_profile_for_bamboo()` - uses bamboo_base_url or base_url
  - `build_bamboo_client()` - uses Basic auth
- Updated `crates/config/src/lib.rs` with new profile fields
- Updated `crates/api/src/lib.rs` with delete_with_body and GenieKey auth

  - Tests GenieKey authentication header
- Created `crates/cli/tests/bamboo_integration.rs` (22 tests)
  - Projects, plans, branches, builds, deployments, agents, queue, server info, artifacts
  - Full CRUD coverage for all major endpoints including artifact list/download

### Test Results
- Total: 47 new integration tests
- JSM: 11 tests passed
- OpsGenie: 14 tests passed
- Bamboo: 22 tests passed

- Files created: `docs/c4model.md`

## 2025-12-26 - Confluence Draft Publishing Fix

### Bug Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed version handling for draft page/blog post publishing
  - Root cause: `update_page()` and `update_blogpost()` always incremented version by 1
  - When publishing drafts (status: "draft" → "current"), Confluence API requires version 1
  - CLI was sending version 2, causing 400 error: "Version number must be 1 when publishing a page for the first time"

### New Commands
- `confluence page publish <PAGE_ID> --body <FILE> [--title <TITLE>] [--message <MSG>]`
  - Publishes a draft page for the first time
  - Requires `--body` flag with content file
  - Validates page is actually a draft before publishing
  - Sends version 1 as required by Confluence API

- `confluence blog publish <BLOGPOST_ID> --body <FILE> [--title <TITLE>] [--message <MSG>]`
  - Same functionality for blog posts

### Enhanced Commands
- `confluence page update` - Added new flags:
  - `--status <current|draft>` - Target status for the page
  - `--message <MSG>` - Version message for audit trail
  - Smart version handling based on status transition

- `confluence blog update` - Same enhancements as page update

### Version Logic
```
draft → current: version stays at 1 (first publish)
draft → draft: version unchanged (draft update)
current → current: version increments by 1 (normal update)
current → draft: error (cannot unpublish)
```

### Error Handling
- Improved `BadRequest` suggestions in `crates/api/src/error.rs`:
  - Detects "Version number must be 1" errors and suggests using `page publish`
  - Detects generic version conflicts and suggests fetching latest

### Files Modified
- `crates/cli/src/commands/confluence/pages.rs` - Version logic fix, added `publish_page()`, `publish_blogpost()`
- `crates/cli/src/commands/confluence/mod.rs` - Added `Publish` subcommands, `--status`, `--message` flags
- `crates/api/src/error.rs` - Improved error suggestions
- `crates/cli/tests/confluence_integration.rs` - Added 3 new tests for draft publishing

### Documentation
- `docs/26122025.md` - Full implementation plan and API reference

### Tests Added
- `test_publish_draft_page` - Verifies draft page publishes with version 1
- `test_update_published_page_increments_version` - Verifies normal updates increment version
- `test_publish_draft_blogpost` - Verifies draft blog post publishes with version 1

## 2025-12-22 - Week 1 Prevention: Pre-commit Hooks & CI Optimization
- Immediate fixes (Day 1):
  - Fixed version test in `crates/cli/tests/cli_integration.rs:15` to use `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`
  - Synced `.release-please-manifest.json` from "0.1.9" to "0.2.0"
  - Ran `cargo clippy --fix` and `cargo fmt` - all 187 tests passing

- Pre-commit hooks with cargo-husky:
  - Added `cargo-husky` to workspace dependencies in `Cargo.toml`
  - Added `cargo-husky` to cli crate dev-dependencies in `crates/cli/Cargo.toml`
  - Created `.cargo-husky/hooks/pre-commit` script with fmt, clippy, and unit test checks
  - Hooks auto-install on `cargo build` (zero friction for contributors)

- CI optimization:
  - Replaced sequential job with parallel jobs (fmt, clippy, test) in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - Upgraded from deprecated `actions-rs/toolchain` to `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable`
  - Added `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2` for dependency caching
  - Added matrix testing (ubuntu-latest + macos-latest)
  - Added `fail-fast: false` to show all failures
  - Expected CI time reduction: 2-3min → 60-90s

- Files created: `.cargo-husky/hooks/pre-commit`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`

## 2025-12-15 (v7) - Add cargo-release for automated version bumping
- Added `cargo-release` configuration to workspace Cargo.toml
  - `shared-version = true` - all crates share the same version
  - `tag-name = "v{{version}}"` - creates tags like `v0.1.8`
  - `pre-release-commit-message = "chore: bump version to {{version}}"`
- Added `[package.metadata.release] release = false` to internal crates (api, auth, config, output, bulk)
- Added `[package.metadata.release] release = true` to CLI crate
- Usage: `cargo release patch --execute` (or `minor`, `major`)
- Files modified: `Cargo.toml`, `crates/*/Cargo.toml`

## 2025-12-15 (v6) - Code Review Fixes
- Fixed progress bar panic risk in `crates/bulk/src/lib.rs:267`
  - Changed `.unwrap()` to `.unwrap_or_else()` with fallback to `ProgressStyle::default_bar()`
  - Logs warning when template is invalid
- Added credential corruption warnings in `crates/auth/src/lib.rs`
  - `set_secret()` and `delete_secret()` now log warnings when JSON parsing fails
  - Previously silently returned empty HashMap on parse errors
- Added rate limiter timeout protection in `crates/api/src/ratelimit.rs`
  - All mutex lock calls now use 5-second timeout via `tokio::time::timeout()`
  - Prevents indefinite blocking if lock is held
  - Methods gracefully degrade: `update_from_response()` skips update, `check_limit()` returns None, `get_info()` returns empty info
- Fixed HTTP client connection pool loss in `crates/cli/src/commands/confluence/attachments.rs`
  - Added `http_client()` method to `ApiClient` to expose underlying reqwest client
  - `upload_attachment()` and `download_attachment()` now reuse connection pool instead of creating new clients
- Added user-visible pagination warning in `crates/cli/src/commands/confluence/bulk.rs`
  - `search_page_ids()` now shows `eprintln` warning when results hit 1000 limit
  - Previously only logged to tracing (not visible to users)
- Files modified: `crates/bulk/src/lib.rs`, `crates/auth/src/lib.rs`, `crates/api/src/lib.rs`, `crates/api/src/ratelimit.rs`, `crates/cli/src/commands/confluence/attachments.rs`, `crates/cli/src/commands/confluence/bulk.rs`

## 2025-12-15 (v5) - Fix Bitbucket-only profile auth flow
- Fixed: Bitbucket-only profiles were rejected because `resolve_active_profile()` required base_url + Jira token
- Root cause: `main.rs:164-220` called same resolution function for all commands
- Solution: Split profile resolution into two functions:
  - `resolve_profile_for_product()` - Jira/Confluence/JSM (requires base_url + token)
  - `resolve_profile_for_bitbucket()` - Bitbucket (requires only email + bitbucket token)
- Shared validation via `BaseProfile` struct and `resolve_base_profile()` helper to avoid duplication
- Changed structs: `ActiveProfile` replaced with `BaseProfile`, `ProductProfile`, `BitbucketProfile`
- Improved error messages: distinguishes "no Bitbucket token (only Jira token found)" vs "no token at all"
- Updated command dispatch to call appropriate resolution function per command type
- Bitbucket profile resolution falls back to general token if no bitbucket-specific token exists
- Added regression tests:
  - `test_bitbucket_only_profile_no_base_url_error` - verifies Bitbucket commands work without base_url
  - `test_jira_still_requires_base_url` - verifies Jira commands still require base_url
- Fixed missing `tracing` dependency in `crates/auth/Cargo.toml` (pre-existing issue)
- Files modified: `crates/cli/src/main.rs`, `crates/cli/tests/cli_integration.rs`, `crates/cli/Cargo.toml`, `crates/auth/Cargo.toml`

## 2025-12-15 (v4) - CLI UX Consistency Refactoring
- Phase 1: Quick fixes
  - Standardized `--limit` defaults to 25 across all products (was 50 in Jira/Confluence)
  - Fixed emoji inconsistency: all `✓` changed to `✅` in Bitbucket files (15 instances)
  - Verified snake_case flag was NOT an issue (clap auto-converts to kebab-case)
  - Files: `jira/mod.rs`, `confluence/mod.rs`, all `bitbucket/*.rs` files

- Phase 2: Output format compliance
  - Created `crates/cli/src/commands/common.rs` with `MutationResult` struct and `render_success()` helper
  - Updated 83+ mutation commands to respect `--output json/yaml/csv/quiet` flags
  - Success messages now render as JSON/YAML/etc when appropriate output format specified
  - Table format still shows emoji messages for human readability
  - Quiet format outputs just the ID when available
  - Files modified: all mutation commands across `jira/*.rs`, `bitbucket/*.rs`, `confluence/*.rs`

- Phase 3: Consistency fixes
  - Standardized confirmation messages to single-line format: `"⚠️  This will permanently delete {resource} {id}. Use --force to confirm."`
  - Standardized empty result messages to `"No {resources} found"` pattern
  - Added user-facing println for all empty results (previously only tracing)
  - Files modified: `jira/issues.rs`, `jira/projects.rs`, `jira/bulk.rs`, `bitbucket/repos.rs`, `bitbucket/pullrequests.rs`, `bitbucket/branches.rs`, `bitbucket/webhooks.rs`, `bitbucket/workspaces.rs`, `bitbucket/permissions.rs`, `bitbucket/pipelines.rs`, `bitbucket/commits.rs`, `confluence/bulk.rs`, `jsm.rs`

- Phase 4: Remove short flags from Jira (BREAKING)
  - Removed short flags `-a`, `-s`, `-y`, `-l`, `-t`, `-p` from Jira search command
  - Now consistent with Bitbucket/Confluence which use long flags only
  - File: `jira/mod.rs`

- Phase 5: Jira command restructure (BREAKING)
  - Moved flat issue commands under `jira issue` subcommand
  - Old: `jira search`, `jira get`, `jira create`, `jira update`, `jira delete`, `jira transition`, `jira assign`, `jira unassign`
  - New: `jira issue search`, `jira issue get`, `jira issue create`, etc.
  - Nested commands also moved: `jira watchers` → `jira issue watchers`, `jira links` → `jira issue links`, `jira comments` → `jira issue comments`
  - Now consistent with Bitbucket (`bb repo`, `bb pr`) and Confluence (`confluence page`, `confluence space`) patterns
  - File: `jira/mod.rs`

- Phase 6: Help text improvements
  - Added `long_about` with usage examples to key commands
  - Jira: `issue search`, `issue create` with JQL and filter flag examples
  - Bitbucket: `repo list`, `repo get`, `repo create` with workspace and flag examples
  - Confluence: `space list`, `space get`, `space create`, `search cql`, `search text`, `search in-space`, `search params` with CQL and filter examples
  - Improved argument descriptions with format examples (e.g., "Space key (e.g., TEAM)")

## 2026-05-16 — SEO overhaul + OSS-unaffiliated positioning (branch `seo/oss-positioning-overhaul`)

Driven by GA4 (`520368061`) + GSC (`sc-domain:atlassiancli.com`) review. Plan: `/Users/macmini/.claude/plans/check-google-analytics-and-imperative-comet.md`. Codex review: `/Users/macmini/projects/codex/atlassiancli_oss_unaffiliated_positioning_review.txt`.

- Phase 1: ship untracked `docs/install/` + `docs/docs/` (index/auth/commands); refresh all `docs/sitemap.xml` `lastmod` → 2026-05-16; add `/about/`.
- Phase 2: `docs/index.html` — codex-recommended `<title>`/meta/OG/Twitter (no "Unofficial" in title), de-brand hero copy, JSON-LD `name`=`atlassian-cli` + `disambiguatingDescription` + `isAccessibleForFree` + `SoftwareSourceCode`, on-page FAQ, hero unaffiliated line.
- Phase 3: nav anchors → "Jira/Confluence/Bitbucket CLI"; reciprocal exact-match links from blog guides → section pages; shared footer legal+trademark block site-wide.
- Phase 4: deepen `runbooks/confluence-markdown-sync.html` (pos 40); above-the-fold TL;DR on `blog/bitbucket-cli-guide.html` (70% bounce).
- Phase 5: site-wide `Atlassian CLI` → `atlassian-cli` rename (title/OG/JSON-LD/breadcrumb/H1); replace Atlassian-imitating product SVGs with generic glyphs; remove `<meta name="keywords">` (23 files); add `docs/about/index.html`, `docs/SECURITY.md`, `docs/.well-known/security.txt`, repo `SECURITY.md`; README + `docs/llms.txt` parity.
- Decisions: full overhaul; keep `atlassiancli.com` domain, de-risk via naming/disclaimers (no migration).

## 2026-08-10 — Jira attachments (issue #93, branch `feat/jira-attachments`)

Plan: `/Users/macmini/.claude/plans/https-github-com-omar16100-atlassian-cli-binary-rossum.md`. Reviewed by kimi before implementation.

- New `jira attachment` group: `list`, `get`, `download` (single, `--output -` to stdout, bulk via `--issue`/`--dir`), `upload` (multi-file), `delete`.
- Fixed pre-existing bug: `init_tracing` had no `.with_writer`, so tracing-subscriber logged to stdout and could corrupt piped binary output. Now stderr.
- Moved `AttachmentField` -> `JiraAttachment` + `de_id_to_string` + `attachments_markdown` from `issues.rs` (2046 lines) into new `jira/attachments.rs`; `issues.rs` now 1993.
- `safe_filename` reduces server-supplied filenames to one path segment (traversal, control chars, Windows illegal/reserved, 255-byte truncation), with proptest.
- Download refuses to clobber without `--force`, diverging from the Confluence command's silent truncate.
- `clap`'s `requires = "issue"` alone silently ignored `--dir` in single mode, because the required `ArgGroup` already counted as satisfied. Needed an explicit `conflicts_with = "attachment_id"`.
- `issue get --format json` gains `author` and `created` per attachment (additive).
- New doc: `docs/10082026_jira_attachments.md`. README Jira section added; stale Confluence attachment flags in README fixed (they documented `--page-id`/`--id` for positional args).
- Codex review found a real hole: bulk download used the server-supplied attachment `id` unvalidated, both in the content URL and as the dedup filename prefix, so an id of `../../owned` on a colliding filename escaped `--dir`. Now validated per row (bad id fails only its own row), and `unique_download_name` filters the id and stays within the 255-byte limit via `fit_filename`.
- Also from review: `write_bytes` uses `create_new` instead of `exists()` + write, closing a TOCTOU and refusing to follow a planted symlink; new `crates/cli/tests/jira_attachment_e2e.rs` drives the real binary against wiremock (the other tests only exercised `ApiClient`); the credential-leak test now requires auth on the Jira mock so it cannot pass vacuously.

## 2026-08-10 — Raw API passthrough `jira api` (issue #93 alternative, branch `feat/jira-api-passthrough`)

- New `crates/cli/src/commands/api.rs` (product-agnostic, wired into `jira` only for now) and `ApiClient::request_raw` / `RawRequest` / `RawResponse` / `resolve_url` in `crates/api`.
- `request_raw` returns non-2xx as `Ok` so the API's own error body survives, and retries 429/5xx only for idempotent methods. The existing `request` retries POSTs, which can double-create. It cannot reuse `retry_with_backoff`: that closure must signal retryable outcomes as `Err`, which would discard the `RawResponse` needed on the final attempt.
- Output bypasses `OutputRenderer::render`. `--format table/csv/markdown/quiet` are ignored because a top-level JSON array would render as a table and silently drop nested fields.
- `--force` gates DELETE only (several Jira read endpoints are POST). Exits 1 rather than returning Ok like `jira issue delete`, so it cannot silently no-op in a script.
- Deferred: `--field`/`--raw-field` (name collides with `jira issue create --field`, which requires strict JSON) and `--paginate` (Jira Cloud has several pagination shapes).
- New doc: `docs/10082026_raw_api_passthrough.md`. README raw-API block added.
- Codex review of the passthrough found two blockers, both fixed: (1) `safe_join` compared scheme and host but **not port**, so any other port on the same host (e.g. another local service on a localhost profile) received the profile's credentials. This was pre-existing and affected every command; now a shared `same_origin` helper compares scheme + host + `port_or_known_default`. (2) `request_raw` used the default redirect policy, so a same-origin endpoint could bounce a credentialed, body-carrying request anywhere: 307/308 replay the body and custom `-H` headers are not stripped. `request_raw` now uses a separate client whose policy follows same-origin redirects only and returns the 3xx otherwise. The ordinary client still follows cross-host redirects, which attachment downloads depend on (guarded by a test).
- Also: `--output` refuses to clobber without `--force` and uses `create_new` (no symlink follow); 429 retries respect `Retry-After`; binary detection now rejects control bytes, not just invalid UTF-8, so a response cannot drive the terminal.
- Consequence: `jira api /rest/api/3/attachment/content/<id>` no longer resolves the media-host hop. Documented, with users pointed at `jira attachment download`.

## 2026-08-10 — Release 0.5.0

Minor bump (not patch): two new command groups plus a new public API on the shared `atlassian-cli-api` crate.

- `jira attachment` group: list/get/download (single, `--output -`, bulk `--issue`/`--dir`)/upload/delete (#93, PR #94).
- `jira api` raw authenticated passthrough (#93 alternative, PR #96).
- `ApiClient::request_raw` / `RawRequest` / `RawResponse` / `resolve_url` added.
- Security fixes shipped along the way, both pre-existing and affecting all commands: `init_tracing` logged to stdout, which could corrupt piped binary output; `safe_join` compared scheme and host but not port, so another port on the same host could receive the profile's credentials.

## 2026-08-10 — Documentation freshness pass (branch `docs/index-and-0.5.0-freshness`)

Audit after the 0.5.0 release, prompted by "is everything documented?".

- Created `docs/index.md`, which never existed. It lists every doc, the `DDMMYYYY_topic.md` vs `topic.md` naming convention, required sections per category, and the rule that a dated feature doc carries a status line kept current.
- Un-staled both 0.5.0 docs: they still said "implemented on <branch>" for branches deleted at merge.
- Corrected the test counts in the passthrough doc (26/5/11 claimed vs 28/10/14 actual) and rewrote its Safety section, which predated the port and redirect fixes.
- `docs/status.md` Jira row still claimed 11 wiremock tests and no attachments; now 21 wiremock plus 23 end-to-end.
- Fixed 19 broken `--output json` invocations across all 9 example scripts. The flag is `--format`; `--output` is not an argument of any of those read commands. Verified each affected subcommand's help. In `backup-space.sh` the error was swallowed by `2>/dev/null || echo "[]"`, so that backup silently saved zero attachments.
- Verified every `atlassian-cli <product> <group> <sub>` path used in the examples resolves against the built binary.
- Extended the audit to the README after finding the example-script rot: **45 of its 128 command examples did not parse**. Causes: Jira issue commands never updated after the `issue` group was introduced (`jira get` -> `jira issue get`), `--id`/`--project`/`--space`/`--cql`/`--query` for arguments that are positional, `confluence bulk` documented as space-driven when it is CQL-driven, `space add-permission`/`page add-restriction` documented with flags that do not exist, pipelines taking `--repo` rather than a positional, and `jsm servicedesk` vs `jsm service-desk`. All fixed and verified.
- Found and fixed a defect in the just-released 0.5.0: `jira api -X PUT` was rejected, because `ValueEnum` derives lowercase variant names and only `-X put` parsed. The README and the command's own help both showed uppercase. Now `ignore_case`.
- New `crates/cli/tests/docs_examples.rs` parses every README command against the built binary (unroutable host, so nothing leaves the process; clap exit code 2 means malformed). Spawned concurrently: 7s instead of 100s. Verified it fails when a command line is broken.

## 2026-08-10 — Release 0.5.1

Patch for a defect shipped in 0.5.0 plus the documentation repair.

- `jira api -X PUT` was rejected; only lowercase `-X put` parsed, while the README and the command's own help showed uppercase.
- `docs/index.md` added; 0.5.0 docs un-staled; `docs/status.md` refreshed.
- 19 broken `--output json` invocations across all 9 example scripts and 45 broken README command examples fixed, with `tests/docs_examples.rs` added so they cannot rot silently again.

## 2026-08-16 — `bb pr reviewers` lists review status; `--add` endpoint fixed (branch `fix/bb-pr-reviewers-followup`)

Issue #102 and PR #103 from an outside contributor, plus the follow-up this repo owed them.

- PR #103 (merged): `bb pr reviewers <repo> <pr_id>` with no `--add` now lists participants with a derived `status` column (Approved / Changes Requested / No Response) instead of looping zero times and printing "✅ Reviewers added to pull request #N". `--all` includes `role == PARTICIPANT` rows. Participants come from the PR GET, which already embeds them, so there is no extra call.
- `--all` combined with `--add` was silently ignored; now `conflicts_with = "add"`, so clap rejects it.
- Fixed `--add`, which had never worked: it PUT `/pullrequests/{id}/default-reviewers/{uuid}`, an endpoint Bitbucket Cloud does not have (repo default reviewers are at `/repositories/{ws}/{repo}/default-reviewers/{user}`, and a PR's reviewer list is replaced by a PUT on the PR). Same class of defect as #100. It now reads the PR's current reviewers, unions the requested UUIDs in, and PUTs `{title, reviewers}` back.
- UUIDs are normalised to Bitbucket's brace form, so `--add abc-123` and `--add '{abc-123}'` both work. `pr create --reviewers` uses the same normalisation, where a bare UUID had the same problem.
- Row filtering moved out of `list_pr_reviewers` into a pure `reviewer_rows()`; 12 unit tests now cover status derivation, REVIEWER-vs-`--all` filtering, empty results, UUID normalisation and the union/dedupe. The added wiremock test pins the PUT path and body.
